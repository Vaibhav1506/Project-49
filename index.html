<p><i><u>Interesting Facts about the Chameleon</u></i></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.</li>
      <li> Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’. A study at Oxford University found that they will also use landmarks as signposts and will travel along man-made roads and motorways, even changing direction at junctions.</li>
      <li> Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.</li>
      <li>Both female and male pigeons share responsibility of caring for and raising young. Both sexes take turn incubating the eggs and both feed the chicks ‘pigeon milk’ – a special secretion from the lining of the crop which both sexes produce.</li>
      <li>Pigeons mate for life, and tend to raise two chicks at the same time.</li>
    </ul>

<p><i><u>Interesting Facts about the flying cicada</u></i></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</li>
        <li>The loud whirring or buzzing sound you hear is an all-male cicada chorus. (Females make a much quieter sound by flicking their wings.) Cicadas don’t sing at night, so don’t blame them if you can’t sleep.</li>
        <li>They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically accurate.</li>
        <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout.</li>
        <li>Females may be attracted to the sound of motors. So you get to watch your dad, mom or older sibling get swarmed while they’re using the lawn mower or power tools.</li>  
      </ul>

<p><i><u>Interesting Facts about the Teddy Bear</u></i></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a 1902 hunting trip.</li>
        <li>Inspired by a cartoon featuring the event, shopkeeper Morris Michtom and his wife Rose made a stuffed bear with a sign ‘Teddy’s bear’ and left it in their shop window. It gained so much attention that they started a successful toy making company.</li>
        <li> Meanwhile, in Germany in the same year, the Steiff family developed a silk-like fabric bear, based on zoo animals. They caused a sensation at a toy fair and were snapped up by an American buyer.</li>
        <li>They aren’t just for children – 40% of teddy sales are for adults, and a quarter of us still has our childhood companion.</li>
        <li>A teddy has been into space! Magellan T Bear boarded Space Shuttle Discovery in 1995 as part of a school project.</li>
